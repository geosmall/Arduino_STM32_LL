paragraph=MAVLink is a very lightweight messaging protocol for communicating with drones (and between onboard drone components). MAVLink follows a modern hybrid publish-subscribe and point-to-point design pattern: Data streams are sent / published as topics while configuration sub-protocols such as the mission protocol or parameter protocol are point-to-point with retransmission.
