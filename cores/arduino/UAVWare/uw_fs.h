// A POSIX-like file system interface that can be implemented by different file systems
// such as FatFS and LittleFS. The interface provides basic operations for mounting,
// unmounting, opening, reading, writing, seeking, closing, and deleting files,
// as well as listing and creating directories.

/* POSIX fopen(3) â€” Linux manual pag
   https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fopen.3.html

   FILE *fopen(const char *restrict pathname, const char *restrict mode);

   The argument [mode] points to a string beginning with one of the
   following sequences (possibly followed by additional characters,
   as described below):

   r      Open text file for reading.  The stream is positioned at
          the beginning of the file.

   r+     Open for reading and writing.  The stream is positioned at
          the beginning of the file.

   w      Truncate file to zero length or create text file for
          writing.  The stream is positioned at the beginning of the
          file.

   w+     Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it
          does not exist, otherwise it is truncated.  The stream is
          positioned at the beginning of the file.

   a      Open for appending (writing at end of file).  The file is
          created if it does not exist.  The stream is positioned at
          the end of the file.

   a+     Open for reading and appending (writing at end of file).
          The file is created if it does not exist.  Output is
          always appended to the end of the file.  POSIX is silent
          on what the initial read position is when using this mode.
          For glibc, the initial file position for reading is at the
          beginning of the file, but for Android/BSD/MacOS, the
          initial file position for reading is at the end of the
          file.
